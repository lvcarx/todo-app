# ToDo Manager

## How to use the app

To use the ToDo App you can go to: https://reallucareichmann.github.io/todo-app/ or download the app and host it on a server by yourself.

## Future plans

### V1.0

Currently the app is pretty simple and has a lot of bugs. The plan for version 1.0 is to solve all of the bugs and to make the app stable.
Also the design needs to finalised.

### V1.1 

To make the app secure it needs a new storing method. That can be a database model for example. But that needs to be discussed.

### V1.2

## Warning!

All the ToDo items are stored (unencrypted) in your Browser Local Storage! 
That means it is not safe and shouldn't be used for sensitive data (like password for example).
